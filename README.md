# BLE Stack Internals

This repository documents my ongoing study of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
stack internals using Zephyr’s public codebase as reference.

Focus areas:
- Host vs Controller boundaries
- Addressing and privacy model
- HCI contract and responsibilities
- ATT/GATT data modeling
- UUID usage at protocol level

This is not a tutorial repo. Notes reflect protocol-level reasoning
and header-level analysis from a firmware perspective.
